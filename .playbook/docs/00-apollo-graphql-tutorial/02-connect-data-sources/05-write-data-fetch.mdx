First, let's recall what a `Launch` object type looks like in our schema:

```graphql
# YOU DON'T NEED TO COPY THIS CODE.
type Launch {
  id: ID!
  site: String
  mission: Mission
  rocket: Rocket
  isBooked: Boolean!
}
```

Now, let's write a `launchReducer` method that transforms launch data from the REST API into the shape above. Copy the following code into your `LaunchAPI` class:

```js:title=src/datasources/launch.js
launchReducer(launch) {
  return {
    id: launch.flight_number || 0,
    cursor: `${launch.launch_date_unix}`,
    site: launch.launch_site && launch.launch_site.site_name,
    mission: {
      name: launch.mission_name,
      missionPatchSmall: launch.links.mission_patch_small,
      missionPatchLarge: launch.links.mission_patch,
    },
    rocket: {
      id: launch.rocket.rocket_id,
      name: launch.rocket.rocket_name,
      type: launch.rocket.rocket_type,
    },
  };
}
```

Using a reducer like this enables the `getAllLaunches` method to remain concise as our definition of a `Launch` potentially changes and grows over time. It also helps with testing the `LaunchAPI` class, which we'll cover later.
