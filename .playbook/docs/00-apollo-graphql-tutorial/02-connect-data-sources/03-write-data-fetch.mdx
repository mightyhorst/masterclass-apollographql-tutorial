### Write data-fetching methods

Our `LaunchAPI` data source needs methods that enable it to fetch the data that incoming queries will request. 

#### The `getAllLaunches` method

According to our schema, we'll need a method to get a list of all SpaceX launches. Let's add a `getAllLaunches` method to our `LaunchAPI` class:

```js:title=src/datasources/launch.js
async getAllLaunches() {
  const response = await this.get('launches');
  return Array.isArray(response)
    ? response.map(launch => this.launchReducer(launch))
    : [];
}
```
