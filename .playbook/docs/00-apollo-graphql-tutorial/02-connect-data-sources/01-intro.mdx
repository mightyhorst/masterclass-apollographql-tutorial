Now that we've constructed our schema, we need to connect data sources to Apollo Server. **A data source is any database, service, or API that holds the data you use to populate your schema's fields.** Your GraphQL API can interact with any combination of data sources.

Apollo provides a `DataSource` class that we can extend to handle interaction logic for a particular type of data source. In this section, we'll extend `DataSource` to connect both a REST API and a SQL database to Apollo Server. Don't worry, you don't need to be familiar with either of these technologies to follow along with the examples.
