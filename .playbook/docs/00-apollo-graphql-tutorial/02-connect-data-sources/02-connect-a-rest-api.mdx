## Connect a REST API

Let's connect the [SpaceX v2 REST API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) to our server. To do so, we'll use the `RESTDataSource` class from the `apollo-datasource-rest` package. This class is an extension of `DataSource` that handles fetching data from a REST API. To use this class, you `extend` it and provide it the base URL of the REST API it will communicate with.

The base URL for the Space-X API is `https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/`. Let's create a data source called `LaunchAPI` by adding the code below to `src/datasources/launch.js`:

```js:title=src/datasources/launch.js
const { RESTDataSource } = require('apollo-datasource-rest');

class LaunchAPI extends RESTDataSource {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.baseURL = 'https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/';
  }
}

module.exports = LaunchAPI;
```

The `RESTDataSource` class automatically caches responses from REST resources with no additional setup. We call this feature **partial query caching**. It enables you to take advantage of the caching logic that the REST API already exposes.
