#### The `getLaunchById` method

Our schema also supports fetching an individual launch by its ID. To support this, let's add _two_ methods to the `LaunchAPI` class: `getLaunchById` and `getLaunchesByIds` :

```js:title=src/datasources/launch.js
async getLaunchById({ launchId }) {
  const response = await this.get('launches', { flight_number: launchId });
  return this.launchReducer(response[0]);
}

getLaunchesByIds({ launchIds }) {
  return Promise.all(
    launchIds.map(launchId => this.getLaunchById({ launchId })),
  );
}
```

The `getLaunchById` method takes a launch's flight number and returns the data for the associated launch. The `getLaunchesByIds` method returns the result of multiple calls to `getLaunchById`.

Our `LaunchAPI` class is complete! Next, let's connect a database to our server.
