Now that we've added multiple queries to our React app, let's add a **mutation**. The process is similar, with a few important differences.

As a reminder, mutations are GraphQL operations that can modify back-end data (unlike queries). Our server's schema supports the following mutations:

```graphql
# YOU DON'T NEED TO COPY THIS.
type Mutation {
  bookTrips(launchIds: [ID]!): TripUpdateResponse!
  cancelTrip(launchId: ID!): TripUpdateResponse!
  login(email: String): String # login token
}
```

We'll start by implementing the ability to log in. Notice that this mutation accepts a single variable, `email`. 


## Support user login

> **Note:** For simplicity, our example application doesn't implement actual user accounts with password-based authentication. Instead, a user unsecurely "logs in" by submitting their email address and receiving a corresponding session token from the server.
