#### Persist the user token

In our call to `useMutation`, we can include an `onCompleted` callback. This enables us to interact with the mutation's result data as soon as it's available. We'll use this callback to persist the user's `token`.

Modify the `useMutation` call in `login.tsx` to match the following:

```tsx:title=src/pages/login.tsx
const [login, { loading, error }] = useMutation<
  LoginTypes.Login,
  LoginTypes.LoginVariables
>(
  LOGIN_USER,
  {
    onCompleted({ login }) {
      localStorage.setItem('token', login.token as string);
      localStorage.setItem('userId', login.id as string);
    }
  }
);
```

Our `onCompleted` callback stores the user's unique ID and session token in `localStorage`, so we can load these values into the in-memory cache the next time the user visits our application. We'll add that functionality in the next chapter.
