### Define the mutation

 To start, navigate to `src/pages/login.tsx` and replace its contents with the following:



```tsx:title=src/pages/login.tsx
import React from 'react'; 
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client'; 

import { LoginForm, Loading } from '../components'; 
import * as LoginTypes from './__generated__/login';

export const LOGIN_USER = gql`
  mutation login($email: String!) {
    login(email: $email) {
      id
      token
    }
  }
`;
```



Our `LOGIN_USER` definition looks just like our queries from the previous section, except it replaces the word `query` with `mutation`. We receive a server-generated `token` in the response from `login`, which represents the user's active session.
