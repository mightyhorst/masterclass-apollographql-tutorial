### Apply the `useMutation` hook

We'll use Apollo Client's `useMutation` [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to execute our `LOGIN_USER` mutation. As with `useQuery`, the hook's result provides properties that help us populate and render our component throughout the mutation's execution.

_Unlike_ `useQuery`, `useMutation` doesn't execute its operation as soon as its component renders. Instead, the hook returns a **mutate function** that we call to execute the mutation whenever we want (such as when the user submits a form).

Add the following to the bottom of `login.tsx`:



```tsx:title=src/pages/login.tsx
export default function Login() {
const [login, { loading, error }] = useMutation<
  LoginTypes.Login,
  LoginTypes.LoginVariables
>(LOGIN_USER);

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>An error occurred</p>;

  return <LoginForm login={login} />;
}
```



* The first object in `useMutation`'s result tuple (`login`) is the mutate function we call to execute the mutation. We pass this function to our `LoginForm` component.
* The second object in the tuple is similar to the result object returned by `useQuery`, including fields for the operation's `loading` and `error` states and the operation's result `data`.

Now whenever a user submits the login form, our `login` mutation is called. The user's `token` is stored in the in-memory cache, _however_ we want that token to be available across multiple visits in the same browser. Let's tackle that next.
