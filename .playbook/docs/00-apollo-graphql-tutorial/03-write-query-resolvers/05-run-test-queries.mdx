## Run test queries

Let's run a test query on our server! Return to GraphQL Playground by running `npm start` and visiting `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser:

Paste the following query into the left text field of GraphQL Playground:

```graphql
# We'll cover more about the structure of a query later in the tutorial.
query GetLaunches {
  launches {
    id
    mission {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Then, click the circular play button in the middle of the page to execute it. Our server's response appears on the right. See how the structure of the response object matches the structure of the query? This correspondence is a fundamental feature of GraphQL.

Now let's try a test query that takes a **GraphQL argument**. Paste the following query and run it:

```graphql
query GetLaunchById {
  launch(id: 60) {
    id
    rocket {
      id
      type
    }
  }
}
```

This query returns the details of the `Launch` object with the `id` `60`.

Instead of hard-coding the argument like the query above, GraphQL Playground lets you set variables in the bottom-left corner. Here's that same query using a variable instead of `60`:

```graphql
query GetLaunchById($id: ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    id
    rocket {
      id
      type
    }
  }
}
```

Now, paste the following into the Query Variables text area of GraphQL Playground:

```json:title=QUERY_VARIABLES
{
  "id": 60
}
```

Feel free to experiment more with running queries and setting variables before moving on.
