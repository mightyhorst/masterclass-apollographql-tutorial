## Paginate results

Currently, `Query.launches` returns a long list of `Launch` objects. This is often more information than a client needs at once, and fetching that much data can be slow. We can improve this field's performance by implementing **pagination**.

Pagination ensures that our server sends data in small chunks. We recommend **cursor-based pagination** for numbered pages, because it eliminates the possibility of skipping an item or displaying the same item more than once. In cursor-based pagination, a constant pointer (or cursor) is used to keep track of where to start in the data set when fetching the next set of results.

Let's set up cursor-based pagination. In `src/schema.js`, update `Query.launches` to match the following, and also add a new type called `LaunchConnection` like so:

```graphql{2-11,16-25}:title=src/schema.js
type Query {
  launches( # replace the current launches query with this one.
    """
    The number of results to show. Must be >= 1. Default = 20
    """
    pageSize: Int
    """
    If you add a cursor here, it will only return results _after_ this cursor
    """
    after: String
  ): LaunchConnection!
  launch(id: ID!): Launch
  me: User
}

"""
Simple wrapper around our list of launches that contains a cursor to the
last item in the list. Pass this cursor to the launches query to fetch results
after these.
"""
type LaunchConnection { # add this below the Query type as an additional type.
  cursor: String!
  hasMore: Boolean!
  launches: [Launch]!
}
```

Now, `Query.launches` takes in two parameters (`pageSize` and `after`) and returns a `LaunchConnection` object. The `LaunchConnection` includes:

* A list of `launches` (the actual data requested by a query)
* A `cursor` that indicates the current position in the data set
* A `hasMore` boolean that indicates whether the data set contains any more items beyond those included in `launches`

Open `src/utils.js` and check out the `paginateResults` function. This is a helper function for paginating data from the server.

Now, let's update the necessary resolver functions to accommodate pagination. Import `paginateResults` and replace the `launches` resolver function in `src/resolvers.js` with the code below:

```js{1,5-26}:title=src/resolvers.js
const { paginateResults } = require('./utils');

module.exports = {
  Query: {
    launches: async (_, { pageSize = 20, after }, { dataSources }) => {
      const allLaunches = await dataSources.launchAPI.getAllLaunches();
      // we want these in reverse chronological order
      allLaunches.reverse();

      const launches = paginateResults({
        after,
        pageSize,
        results: allLaunches
      });

      return {
        launches,
        cursor: launches.length ? launches[launches.length - 1].cursor : null,
        // if the cursor at the end of the paginated results is the same as the
        // last item in _all_ results, then there are no more results after this
        hasMore: launches.length
          ? launches[launches.length - 1].cursor !==
            allLaunches[allLaunches.length - 1].cursor
          : false
      };
    },
    launch: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchById({ launchId: id }),
     me: async (_, __, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.userAPI.findOrCreateUser(),
  }
};
```

Let's test the cursor-based pagination we just implemented. Restart your server with `npm start` and run this query in GraphQL Playground:

```graphql
query GetLaunches {
  launches(pageSize: 3) {
    launches {
      id
      mission {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Thanks to our pagination implementation, the server should only return three launches instead of the full list.

That takes care of the resolvers for our schema's queries! Next, let's write resolvers for its [mutations](./mutation-resolvers).
