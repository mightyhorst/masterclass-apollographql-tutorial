## Define top-level resolvers

As mentioned above, the resolver for a parent field always executes before the resolvers for that field's children. Therefore, let's start by defining resolvers for some top-level fields: the fields of the `Query` type.

As `src/schema.js` shows, our schema's `Query` type defines three fields: `launches`, `launch`, and `me`. To define resolvers for these fields, open `src/resolvers.js` and paste the code below:

```js:title=src/resolvers.js
module.exports = {
  Query: {
    launches: (_, __, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.launchAPI.getAllLaunches(),
    launch: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchById({ launchId: id }),
    me: (_, __, { dataSources }) => dataSources.userAPI.findOrCreateUser()
  }
};
```

As this code shows, we define our resolvers in a **map**, where the map's keys correspond to our schema's types (`Query`) and fields (`launches`, `launch`, `me`).

Regarding the function arguments above:

* All three resolver functions assign their first [positional argument](#the-resolver-function-signature) (`parent`) to the variable `_` as a convention to indicate that they don't use its value.

* The `launches` and `me` functions assign their _second_ positional argument (`args`) to `__` for the same reason. 

    * (The `launch` function _does_ use the `args` argument, however, because our schema's `launch` field takes an `id` argument.)

* All three resolver functions _do_ use the third positional argument (`context`). Specifically, they destructure it to access the [`dataSources` we defined](./data-source).

* None of the resolver functions includes the fourth positional argument (`info`), because they don't use it and there's no other need to include it.

As you can see, these resolver functions are short! That's possible because most of the logic they rely on is part of the `LaunchAPI` and `UserAPI` data sources. By keeping resolvers thin as a best practice, you can safely refactor your backing logic while reducing the likelihood of breaking your API.
