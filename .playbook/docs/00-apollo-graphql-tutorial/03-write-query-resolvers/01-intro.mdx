title: "3. Write query resolvers"
description: Learn how a GraphQL query fetches data
---

We've designed our schema and configured our data sources, but our server doesn't know how to _use_ its data sources to populate schema fields. To solve this, we'll define a collection of resolvers.

**A resolver is a function that's responsible for populating the data for a single field in your schema.** Whenever a client queries for a particular field, the resolver for that field fetches the requested data from the appropriate data source.

A resolver function returns one of the following:

* Data of the type required by the resolver's corresponding schema field (string, integer, object, etc.)
* A promise that fulfills with data of the required type
