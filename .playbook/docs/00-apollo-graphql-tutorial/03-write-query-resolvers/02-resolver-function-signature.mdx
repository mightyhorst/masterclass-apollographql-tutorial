## The resolver function signature

Before we start writing resolvers, let's cover what a resolver function's signature looks like. Resolver functions can optionally accept four positional arguments:

```js
fieldName: (parent, args, context, info) => data;
```

| Argument  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `parent` | This is the return value of the resolver for this field's parent (the resolver for a parent field always executes _before_ the resolvers for that field's children).  |
| `args` |  This object contains all [GraphQL arguments](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/) provided for this field. |
| `context` | This object is shared across all resolvers that execute for a particular operation. Use this to share per-operation state, such as authentication information and access to data sources. |
| `info` | This contains information about the execution state of the operation (used only in advanced cases). |

Of these four arguments, the resolvers we define will mostly use `context`. It enables our resolvers to share instances of our `LaunchAPI` and `UserAPI` data sources. To see how that works, let's get started creating some resolvers.
