We've written all of the resolvers we need for schema fields that apply to query operations. Now, let's write resolvers for our schema's **mutations**. This process is nearly identical.

## `login`

First, let's write a resolver for `Mutation.login`, which enables a user to log in to our application. Add the following to your resolver map below the `Query` field:

```js:title=src/resolvers.js
// Query: {
//   ...
// },
Mutation: {
  login: async (_, { email }, { dataSources }) => {
    const user = await dataSources.userAPI.findOrCreateUser({ email });
    if (user) return Buffer.from(email).toString('base64');
  }
},
```

This resolver takes an `email` address and returns a login token for a corresponding user entity. If a user entity doesn't yet exist for this email address, one is created.

In a later chapter, we'll learn how to save this login token on the client.
