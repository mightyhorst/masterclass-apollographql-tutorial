### Book trips

Let's try booking some trips. Only authenticated users are allowed to book trips, so we'll include our login token in our request.

First, paste the mutation below into GraphQL playground:

```graphql
mutation BookTrips {
  bookTrips(launchIds: [67, 68, 69]) {
    success
    message
    launches {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Next, paste the following into the HTTP Headers box in the bottom left:

```json:title=HTTP_HEADERS
{
  "authorization": "ZGFpc3lAYXBvbGxvZ3JhcGhxbC5jb20="
}
```

It should look like this:

Run the mutation. You should see a success message, along with the `id`s of the trips we just booked.

Running mutations manually in GraphQL Playground is a helpful way to test out our API, but a real-world application needs additional tooling to make sure its data graph grows and changes safely. In the next section, we'll connect our server to Apollo Studio to activate that tooling.
