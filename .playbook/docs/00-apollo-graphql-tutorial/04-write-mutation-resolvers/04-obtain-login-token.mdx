### Obtain a login token

GraphQL mutations are structured exactly like queries, except they use the `mutation` keyword. Paste the mutation below and run it in GraphQL Playground:

```graphql
mutation LoginUser {
  login(email: "daisy@apollographql.com")
}
```

The server should respond with a string that looks like this: 

```
ZGFpc3lAYXBvbGxvZ3JhcGhxbC5jb20=
```

This is your login token (which is just the Base64 encoding of the email address you provided). Copy it to use in the next mutation.
