## `bookTrips` and `cancelTrip`

Now let's add resolvers for `bookTrips` and `cancelTrip` to the `Mutation` object:

```js:title=src/resolvers.js
//Mutation: {
  
  // login: ...

  bookTrips: async (_, { launchIds }, { dataSources }) => {
    const results = await dataSources.userAPI.bookTrips({ launchIds });
    const launches = await dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchesByIds({
      launchIds,
    });

    return {
      success: results && results.length === launchIds.length,
      message:
        results.length === launchIds.length
          ? 'trips booked successfully'
          : `the following launches couldn't be booked: ${launchIds.filter(
              id => !results.includes(id),
            )}`,
      launches,
    };
  },
  cancelTrip: async (_, { launchId }, { dataSources }) => {
    const result = await dataSources.userAPI.cancelTrip({ launchId });

    if (!result)
      return {
        success: false,
        message: 'failed to cancel trip',
      };

    const launch = await dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchById({ launchId });
    return {
      success: true,
      message: 'trip cancelled',
      launches: [launch],
    };
  },
```

To match our schema, these two resolvers both return an object that conforms to the structure of the `TripUpdateResponse` type. This type's fields include a `success` indicator, a status `message`, and an array of `launches` that the mutation either booked or canceled.

> The `bookTrips` resolver needs to account for the possibility of a **partial success**, where some launches are booked successfully and others fail. The code above indicates a partial success in the `message` field.
