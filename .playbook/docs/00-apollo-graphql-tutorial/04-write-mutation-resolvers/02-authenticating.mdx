### Authenticating logged-in users

> The authentication method used in our example application is not at all secure and should not be used by production applications. However, you can apply the principles demonstrated below to a token-based authentication method that _is_ secure.

Our `Mutation.login` resolver returns a token that clients can use to authenticate themselves to our server. Now, we need to add logic to our server to actually perform the authentication.

In `src/index.js`, import the `isEmail` function and pass a `context` function to the constructor of `ApolloServer` that matches the following:

```js{1,4-16}:title=src/index.js
const isEmail = require('isemail');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  context: async ({ req }) => {
    // simple auth check on every request
    const auth = req.headers && req.headers.authorization || '';
    const email = Buffer.from(auth, 'base64').toString('ascii');

    if (!isEmail.validate(email)) return { user: null };

    // find a user by their email
    const users = await store.users.findOrCreate({ where: { email } });
    const user = users && users[0] || null;

    return { user: { ...user.dataValues } };
  },
  // Additional constructor options
});
```

The `context` function defined above is called once for _every GraphQL operation_ that clients send to our server. The return value of this function becomes the [`context` argument](./resolvers/#the-resolver-function-signature) that's passed to every resolver that runs as part of that operation.

Here's what our `context` function does:

1. Obtain the value of the `Authorization` header (if any) included in the incoming request.
2. Decode the value of the `Authorization` header.
3. If the decoded value resembles an email address, obtain user details for that email address from the database and return an object that includes those details in the `user` field.

By creating this `context` object at the beginning of each operation's execution, all of our resolvers can access the details for the logged-in user and perform actions specifically _for_ that user.
