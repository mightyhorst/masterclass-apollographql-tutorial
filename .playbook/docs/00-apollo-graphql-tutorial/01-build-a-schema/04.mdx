## Define your schema's types

Your GraphQL schema defines what types of data a client can read and write to your data graph. Schemas are strongly typed, which unlocks powerful developer tooling.

Your schema's structure should support the actions that your clients will take. Our example app needs to be able to:

* Fetch a list of all upcoming rocket launches
* Fetch a specific launch by its ID
* Log in the user
* Book a launch for a logged-in user
* Cancel a previously booked launch for a logged-in user

Let's design our schema to make these actions straightforward.

In `src/schema.js`, import `gql` from `apollo-server` and create a variable called `typeDefs` for your schema:

```js:title=src/schema.js
const { gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # Your schema will go here
`;

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

The schema will go inside the `gql` function (between the backticks). The language we'll use to write the schema is GraphQL's schema definition language (SDL).

> Because the schema sits directly between your application clients and your underlying data services, front-end and back-end teams should collaborate on its structure. When you develop your own data graph, practice **schema-first development** and agree on a schema _before_ you begin implementing your API.
