> Time to accomplish: 15 minutes

Every data graph uses a **schema** to define the types of data it includes. For example, the schema for an online bookstore might define the following types:

```graphql
type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  name: String
  books: [Book]
}
```

In the steps below, we'll set up a GraphQL server that will enforce our schema's structure, and then we'll define the schema itself.
