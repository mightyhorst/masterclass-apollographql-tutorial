### The `Query` type

We've defined the objects that exist in our data graph, but clients don't yet have a way to _fetch_ those objects. To resolve that, our schema needs to define  **queries** that clients can execute against the data graph.

You define your data graph's supported queries as fields of a special type called the `Query` type. Paste the following into your schema definition:

```graphql:title=src/schema.js
type Query {
  launches: [Launch]!
  launch(id: ID!): Launch
  me: User
}
```

This `Query` type defines three available queries for clients to execute: `launches`, `launch`, and `me`.

* The `launches` query will return an array of all upcoming `Launch`es.
* The `launch` query will return a single `Launch` that corresponds to the `id` argument provided to the query.
* The `me` query will return details for the `User` that's currently logged in.
