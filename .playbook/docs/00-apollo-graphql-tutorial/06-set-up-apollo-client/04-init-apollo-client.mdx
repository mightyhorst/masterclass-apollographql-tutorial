Let's create our instance of `ApolloClient` by pasting the following into `src/index.tsx`:

```tsx:title=src/index.tsx
import {
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  gql,
  NormalizedCacheObject
} from '@apollo/client';

const client: ApolloClient<NormalizedCacheObject> = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```


The `ApolloClient` constructor requires two parameters:

* The `uri` of our GraphQL server (in this case `localhost:4000`)
* An instance of `InMemoryCache` to use as the client's `cache`

In just these few lines of code, our client is ready to fetch data!
