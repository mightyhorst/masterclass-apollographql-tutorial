### Install the Apollo extension for VSCode (optional)

Apollo provides an extension for Visual Studio Code that includes loads of helpful features, such as syntax highlighting, GraphQL field suggestions via IntelliSense, and in-line performance estimates.

1. Most of the VSCode extension's features are powered by Apollo Studio. To get the most out of the extension, make sure to first complete [Connect to Apollo Studio](./production/).

2. Like Apollo Server, the VSCode extension uses an [API key](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/api-keys/) to communicate with Studio. You provide this API key by setting the value of the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable.

Create a `.env` file in `start/client` by making a copy of `start/client/.env.example`. Then paste your API key into it like so:

<form class="playbook-vars">
    <div class="row">
        <label for="PASTE_YOUR_APOLLO_KEY">PASTE_YOUR_APOLLO_KEY</label>
        <input id="PASTE_YOUR_APOLLO_KEY" />
    </div>
</form>

```none:title=.env
APOLLO_KEY={{PASTE_YOUR_APOLLO_KEY}}
```    

Our key is now stored under the environment variable `APOLLO_KEY`. Apollo VSCode uses this API key to fetch your server's schema from the Apollo schema registry.

3. Also in `start/client`, open the empty file called `apollo.config.js`. You use this file to configure the behavior of both the Apollo VSCode extension and the Apollo CLI. 

    Paste the snippet below into the file:

<form class="playbook-vars">
    <div class="row">
        <label for="PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE">PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE</label>
        <input id="PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE" />
    </div>
</form>

```js:title=apollo.config.js
module.exports = {
    client: {
        name: 'Space Explorer [web]',
        service: '{{PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE}}',
    },
};
```

Replace `{{PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE}}` with the unique name of the graph you created in Studio in the previous chapter.

That takes care of the VSCode extension! Now, let's dive into building our first client.
