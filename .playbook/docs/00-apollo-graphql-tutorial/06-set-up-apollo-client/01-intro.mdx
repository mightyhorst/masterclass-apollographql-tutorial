**Apollo Client** is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript. It enables you to use GraphQL to manage both local and remote data. Apollo Client is view-layer agnostic, so you can use it with React, Vue, Angular, or even vanilla JS.

This tutorial uses React (which Apollo Client's core library supports out of the box), but the underlying concepts are the same for every view layer.
