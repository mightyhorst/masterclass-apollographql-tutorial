## Setup

We'll be working in the `start/client/` directory of our tutorial repo ([clone the repo here](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial/) if you skipped the server portion). From that directory, run:

```bash:title=workspaces/client/
yarn install
```

Along with installing other dependencies, this installs the `@apollo/client` package, which includes all of the Apollo Client features we'll use.
