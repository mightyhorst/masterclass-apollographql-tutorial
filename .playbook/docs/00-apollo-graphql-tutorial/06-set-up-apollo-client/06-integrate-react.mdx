## Integrate with React

By adding Apollo Client to our React app, we can use Apollo hooks to bind the results of GraphQL operations directly to our UI.

To connect Apollo Client to React, we wrap our app in the `ApolloProvider` component included in the `@apollo/client` package. We pass the component our `ApolloClient` instance via the `client` prop.

> The `ApolloProvider` component is similar to Reactâ€™s context provider: it wraps your React app and places the client on the context, which allows you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

Open `src/index.tsx` and update it to match the following:

```tsx:title=src/index.tsx
import {
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  NormalizedCacheObject,
  ApolloProvider
} from '@apollo/client';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Pages from './pages';
import injectStyles from './styles';

const client: ApolloClient<NormalizedCacheObject> = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

injectStyles();
ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <Pages />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now, we're ready to start building our first component with the `useQuery` hook in the next section.
