## Fetching a single launch

Let's navigate to `src/pages/launch.tsx` to build out our detail page. First, we should import some components and define our GraphQL query to get the launch details.



```tsx:title=src/pages/launch.tsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'; // preserve-line
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'; // preserve-line

import { Loading, Header, LaunchDetail } from '../components'; // preserve-line
import { ActionButton } from '../containers'; // preserve-line
import { RouteComponentProps } from '@reach/router';
import * as LaunchDetailsTypes from './__generated__/LaunchDetails';

export const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {
      id
      site
      isBooked
      rocket {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      mission {
        name
        missionPatch
      }
    }
  }
`;
```



Now that we have a query, let's render a component with `useQuery` to execute it. This time, we'll also need to pass in the `launchId` as a variable to the query, which we'll do by adding a `variables` option to `useQuery`. The `launchId` comes through as a prop from the router.



```tsx:title=src/pages/launch.tsx
interface LaunchProps extends RouteComponentProps {
  launchId?: any;
}

const Launch: React.FC<LaunchProps> = ({ launchId }) => {
  const {
    data,
    loading,
    error
  } = useQuery<
    LaunchDetailsTypes.LaunchDetails,
    LaunchDetailsTypes.LaunchDetailsVariables
  >(GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS,
    { variables: { launchId } }
  );

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR: {error.message}</p>;
  if (!data) return <p>Not found</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header image={data.launch && data.launch.mission && data.launch.mission.missionPatch}>
        {data && data.launch && data.launch.mission && data.launch.mission.name}
      </Header>
      <LaunchDetail {...data.launch} />
      <ActionButton {...data.launch} />
    </Fragment>
  );
}

export default Launch;
```

Just like before, we use the status of the query to render either a `loading` or `error` state, or data when the query completes.
