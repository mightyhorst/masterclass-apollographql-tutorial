### Using fragments to share code

You may have noticed that the queries for fetching a list of launches and fetching a launch detail share a lot of the same fields. When we have two GraphQL operations that contain the same fields, we can use a **fragment** to share fields between the two.

To learn how to build a fragment, navigate to `src/pages/launches.tsx` and copy the code below into the file:


```tsx:title=src/pages/launches.tsx
export const LAUNCH_TILE_DATA = gql`
  fragment LaunchTile on Launch {
    id
    isBooked
    rocket {
      id
      name
    }
    mission {
      name
      missionPatch
    }
  }
`;
```


We define a GraphQL fragment by giving it a name (`LaunchTile`) and defining it on a type on our schema (`Launch`). The name we give our fragment can be anything, but the type must correspond to a type in our schema.

To use our fragment in our query, we import it into the GraphQL document and use the spread operator to spread the fields into our query:


```tsx{7}:title=src/pages/launches.tsx
const GET_LAUNCHES = gql`
  query launchList($after: String) {
    launches(after: $after) {
      cursor
      hasMore
      launches {
        ...LaunchTile
      }
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```

Let's use our fragment in our launch detail query too. Be sure to import the fragment from the `launches` page before you use it:


```tsx:title=src/pages/launch.tsx
import { LAUNCH_TILE_DATA } from './launches';

export const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {
      site
      rocket {
        type
      }
      ...LaunchTile
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```


Great, now we've successfully refactored our queries to use fragments. Fragments are a helpful tool that you'll use a lot as you're building GraphQL queries and mutations.

### Customizing the fetch policy

Sometimes, it's useful to tell Apollo Client to bypass the cache altogether if you have some data that constantly needs to be refreshed. We can do this by customizing the `useQuery` hook's `fetchPolicy`.

First, let's navigate to `src/pages/profile.tsx` and write our query:


```tsx:title=src/pages/profile.tsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'; // preserve-line
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'; // preserve-line

import { Loading, Header, LaunchTile } from '../components'; // preserve-line
import { LAUNCH_TILE_DATA } from './launches'; // preserve-line
import { RouteComponentProps } from '@reach/router';
import * as GetMyTripsTypes from './__generated__/GetMyTrips';

export const GET_MY_TRIPS = gql`
  query GetMyTrips {
    me {
      id
      email
      trips {
        ...LaunchTile
      }
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```


Next, let's render a component with `useQuery` to fetch a logged in user's list of trips. By default, Apollo Client's fetch policy is `cache-first`, which means it checks the cache to see if the result is there before making a network request. Since we want this list to always reflect the newest data from our graph API, we set the `fetchPolicy` for this query to `network-only`:

```tsx:title=src/pages/profile.tsx
interface ProfileProps extends RouteComponentProps {}

const Profile: React.FC<ProfileProps> = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery<GetMyTripsTypes.GetMyTrips, any>(
    GET_MY_TRIPS,
    { fetchPolicy: "network-only" } // highlight-line
  );
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR: {error.message}</p>;
  if (data === undefined) return <p>ERROR</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header>My Trips</Header>
      {data.me && data.me.trips.length ? (
        data.me.trips.map((launch: any) => (
          <LaunchTile key={launch.id} launch={launch} />
        ))
      ) : (
        <p>You haven't booked any trips</p>
      )}
    </Fragment>
  );
}

export default Profile;
```

If you try to render this query, you'll notice that it returns null. This is because we need to implement our login feature first. We're going to tackle login in the next section.

Now that we've learned how to leverage `useQuery` to build components that can fetch a paginated list, share fragments, and customize the fetch policy, it's time to progress to the next section so we can learn how to update data with mutations!
