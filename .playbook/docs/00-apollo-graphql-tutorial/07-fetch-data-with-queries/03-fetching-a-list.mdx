## Fetching a list

To create a component with `useQuery`, import `useQuery` from `@apollo/client`, pass your query wrapped with `gql` in as the first parameter, then wire your component up to use the `loading`, `data`, and `error` properties on the result object to render UI in your app.

First, we're going to build a GraphQL query that fetches a list of launches. We're also going to import some components that we will need in the next step. Navigate to `src/pages/launches.tsx` to get started and copy the code below into the file.



```tsx:title=src/pages/launches.tsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'; // preserve-line
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'; // preserve-line

import { LaunchTile, Header, Button, Loading } from '../components'; // preserve-line
import { RouteComponentProps } from '@reach/router';
import * as GetLaunchListTypes from './__generated__/GetLaunchList';

const GET_LAUNCHES = gql`
  query launchList($after: String) {
    launches(after: $after) {
      cursor
      hasMore
      launches {
        id
        isBooked
        rocket {
          id
          name
        }
        mission {
          name
          missionPatch
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```



Here, we're defining a query to fetch a list of launches by calling the `launches` query from our schema. The `launches` query returns an object type with a list of launches, in addition to the `cursor` of the paginated list and whether or not the list `hasMore` launches. We need to wrap the query with the `gql` function in order to parse it into an AST.

Now, let's pass that query to Apollo's `useQuery` component to render the list. Copy and paste the following code after the query:



```tsx:title=src/pages/launches.tsx
interface LaunchesProps extends RouteComponentProps {}

const Launches: React.FC<LaunchesProps> = () => {
  const {
    data,
    loading,
    error
  } = useQuery<
    GetLaunchListTypes.GetLaunchList,
    GetLaunchListTypes.GetLaunchListVariables
  >(GET_LAUNCHES);

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR</p>;
  if (!data) return <p>Not found</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header />
      {data.launches &&
        data.launches.launches &&
        data.launches.launches.map((launch: any) => (
          <LaunchTile key={launch.id} launch={launch} />
        ))}
    </Fragment>
  );
}

export default Launches;
```



To render the list, we pass the `GET_LAUNCHES` query from the previous step into our `useQuery` hook. Then, depending on the state of `loading`, `error`, and `data`, we either render a loading indicator, an error message, or a list of launches.

We're not done yet! Right now, this query is only fetching the first 20 launches from the list. To fetch the full list of launches, we need to build a pagination feature that displays a `Load More` button for loading more items on the screen. Let's learn how!
