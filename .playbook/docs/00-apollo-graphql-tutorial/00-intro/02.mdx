## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you're familiar with both JavaScript/ES6
and React. If you need to brush up on React, we recommend going through the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

> Building your frontend with React is not a requirement for using the Apollo 
> platform, but it is the primary view layer supported by Apollo.
> If you use another view layer (such as Angular or Vue), you can still 
> apply this tutorial's concepts to it.

### System requirements

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.x or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later

Although it isn't required, we also recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
as your editor so you can use Apollo's helpful VS Code extension.
