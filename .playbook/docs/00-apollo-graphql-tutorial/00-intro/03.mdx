## Clone the example app

Now the fun begins! From your preferred development directory, clone [this repository](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial.git
```

The repository contains two top-level directories: `start` and `final`. During the
tutorial you'll edit the files in `start`, and at the end they'll match the
completed app in `final`.

Each top-level directory contains two directories of its own: `server` and `client`. We'll be working in the `server` directory first. If you're already comfortable
building a graph API and you want to skip to the `client` portion, navigate to the [second half of the tutorial](/tutorial/client/).
