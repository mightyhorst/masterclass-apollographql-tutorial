description: Start here to learn how to build full-stack apps with Apollo
---

Welcome! This tutorial guides you through building a full-stack, GraphQL-powered app with the Apollo platform.

We want you to feel empowered to build your own production-ready app with Apollo, so 
we're skipping "Hello World" in favor of an example that's closer to "Real
World", complete with authentication, pagination, testing, and more. 

Ready? Let's dive in!

## What we'll build

In this tutorial, we'll build an interactive app for reserving a seat on an upcoming SpaceX launch. Think of it as an Airbnb for space travel! All of the data is real, thanks to the [SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

Here's what the finished app will look like:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/a81f37ed9dd7c56e7eb9ee3b52769e8d/space-explorer.png" alt="Space explorer" width="400">
</div>

The app includes the following views:

* A login page
* A list of upcoming launches
* A detail view for an individual launch
* A user profile page
* A cart

To populate these views, our app's data graph will connect to two data sources: 
a REST API and a SQLite database. (Don't worry, you don't need to be familiar with
either of those technologies to complete the tutorial.)

As mentioned, we want this example to resemble a real-world Apollo app, so we'll
also add common useful features like authentication, pagination, and state
management.
